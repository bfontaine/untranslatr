# Untranslatr

Untranslatr is a fork of [Translatr](https://github.com/softvar/translatr) that
does the opposite of it: instead of translating a piece of text from one
language to multiple ones, it translate that same piece of text from multiple
languages into one: English.

## But why?

There are countless examples of company/product names that sound ok in one
language but mean something completely different in another. Untranslatr helps
you find these issues in one click.
